# Twitch App: Who Is Online?
This is a basic Twitch App created as per the instructions on freeCodeCamp for the legacy Front End Developer Certificate. The app has a list of streamers and performs an API call to FCC's Twitch API to gather current information on the streamers and shows whether they are online or offline.

There is a working version of this repo at the following link: [Twitch App](https://codepen.io/noctearmy/pen/devmpB)
